Activity 4.1 Convert Gallons to Liters
 
Task:
 
Write a program to convert gallons to liters.  One U.S. gallon is equivalent to 3.78541178 liters.

  
Pseudocode would look like:
  
 - Use Scanner to read in the number of gallons.
 - Store the number of gallons in a variable.
 - Multiply that variable by 3.78541178 (variable*3.78541178) and store this new value into a second 
      variable (Hint: use double for the variables, not int).
 - Display the output.
